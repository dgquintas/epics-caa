How to pass values to the methods
---------------------------------
Two ways: in the URL itself as arguments
          via PUT in json format
The first one is probably easier to implement for everybody
and we don't really need json (no long or complex lists
of arguments).

How to output data from the server
-----------------------------------
In JSON format. 


Signaling success/failure
--------------------------
At the HTTP level, all api methods should always return code 200.
Otherwise something is wrong at the http server level. 
At the application level, a JSON "list" list returned. Its first element
signals success of failure with strings "ok" and "fail" respectively. 
In the event of an "ok", the second element will contain the result.
Upon "fail", it'd contain information about the error.
